# Webcam-Motion-Detector
A python project that utilizes the webcam and will detect motion highlighted by a green box. After the program closes, it will take the motion data and output a CSV and a graph that plots the amount of time there was motion detected. 

PLEASE NOTE: PRESS "Q" TO QUIT THE PROGRAM! 

Modules Used: 

Open CV

Bokeh

Pandas

PLEASE READ THIS FIRST - The repository contains two primary scripts called "motion_detector.py" and "plotting.py". If you want to just play around with the webcam, feel free to just run the Motion Detector and it will only output a CSV of times there was motion. If you would like to see a plotting graph, only run the Plotting script. This will activate the Motion Detector. Once you quit the program the graph will be plotted into an HTML file to view within your browser. 

For best results, make sure there is nothing (like a person or moving object) in view of the webcam when starting the program. Then, enter into the webcam view to see the motion. 

To Run the Program: 

Make sure you have all modules installed. 

Open the terminal and run the "plotting.py" script. 

Once finished, press "Q" on the keyboard to quit program. 

Both a CSV and a Graph.HTML file should appear within your directory. 

Open the Graph.HTML file within your local browser to see the times of your motion.
